# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning
## Overview
The main purpose of this assignment was to assist the Advisory team at Accountability Accounting build their new cryptocurrency portfolio. Using unsupervised machine learning, I created a report that organized and clustered different crptocurrencies to determine if they should be added to the new portfolio. In completing this challenge, I had difficulty with the importing hvplot.pandas and the import plotly.express. Unfortunately I could not get the final steps to load; however, I should have enough code to see which cryptocurrencies could be added.
